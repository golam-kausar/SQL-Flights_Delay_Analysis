# SQL-Flights_Delay_Analysis
#### This project analyzes flight delay data to uncover trends and patterns affecting flight punctuality. It explores the comparison between scheduled and actual departure times, identifies routes and carriers with the most delays, and evaluates how factors like weather, flight distance, and seasonal variations impact delays. The analysis also includes metrics on carrier performance, frequent delay patterns by aircraft, and day-of-week and month trends. These insights aim to help airlines and passengers understand and mitigate factors contributing to flight delays.
